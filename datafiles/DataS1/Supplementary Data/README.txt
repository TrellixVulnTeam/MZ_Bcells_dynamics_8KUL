Folders:
--------

1. Datafiles

CSV files containing all data used for fitting mathematical models, drawing statistical inference and plotting figures. 
The observations of total numbers (counts), normalized donor fraction (Nfd), and the proportion of cells that are Ki67+ (Ki67), within host and donor compartments
 for each B cell subset -- FM, Splenic GC (SPGC) and Lymph-node GC (LNGC)
Columns:
Lamis.ID - Mouse identifier
days.post.BMT - Time  in days since Bone marrow transfer from donor mice.
age.at.S1K - Host age at which cells were harvested.
age.at.BMT - Age of the host at the time of Bone marrow transfer.


2. Parameters_tables
- CSV files containing parameter estimates from all the fitted mathematical models.
Files:
For each B cell subset (FM, SPGC and LNGC B cells), the file contains parameter estimates (Mean values and 95% CI) for all models considered (see Tables S1, S2 and S3) 
Includes the estimated standard deviation of scatter associated with each observable (sigma 1 to 4).
