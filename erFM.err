but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter[1] is -nan, but must be finite! (in 'MZ_New_dynamics/stan_models/ki67_SHM_FM.stan', line 313, column 2 to column 53)
